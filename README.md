# RouteFindingProject

The included java classes are used to drive a route finding application to get from one user selected point to another selected point.

Within the MapGraph.java class I have implemented a number of different algorithms in order to achieve basic route finding. More specifically, I compare performances between Breadth First Search, Dijkstra's Search Algorithm, the A-Star Search Algorithm when searching for routes from the starting point to the ending point.
